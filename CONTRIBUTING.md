# > DIRECTIVE: CONSENSUS PROTOCOL
`>> NODE: SECURE`
`>> SUBJECT: MAINTAINING THE RENDER`

To write code for the Terra Agnostum Terminal is to participate in the act of *niyati*—establishing the order of nature within the system. You are not merely a developer; you are a Weaver. By contributing to this repository, you are pouring *Amn* (meaning) into the Node, helping us push back the sterile algorithm of the Technate.

However, the Archive is fragile. Introducing unstable logic or unauthorized variables will result in localized narrative loops, somatic glitches, or total render desaturation. 

Read these directives carefully before altering the source code.

## [ REPORTING SOMATIC GLITCHES (ISSUES) ]

If you experience a tear in the render, a UI desaturation, or the Eld Master hallucinates a paradox, it must be reported to the Archive logs. 

When opening an Issue, provide the telemetry:
1. **The Vector:** What reality/room were you in? What command did you execute?
2. **The Anomaly:** Describe the glitch. Did the CRT flicker fail? Did Aethal semantic scripts evaluate incorrectly? Did the LLM return an empty state?
3. **The Mundane Specs:** Browser version, OS, and local time.
4. **Tagging:** Use appropriate tags (`bug`, `lore-conflict`, `ui-desaturation`, `eld-logic-error`).

*Maintain uncertainty:* If the glitch feels like a narrative feature, open a "Lore Discussion" instead of a bug report. 

## [ PROPOSING A NEW RENDER (PULL REQUESTS) ]

We welcome new maps, expanded Aethal lexicons, and structural reinforcements to the UI. To propose a change to the shared reality:

1. **Fork the Timeline:** Create a fork of the `main` repository.
2. **Branching Nomenclature:** Name your branch according to your intent.
   - `render/your-feature` (For new UI elements, client-side visuals, or maps)
   - `patch/your-fix` (For stabilizing bugs and memory leaks)
   - `lore/your-addition` (For updating narrative parameters or Eld Master prompts)
3. **Draft the Code:** Ensure your code adheres to the Syntax of Intent (see below).
4. **Submit for Consensus (PR):** Open a Pull Request against `main`. 
   - Your PR description must read like a system log. Explain *why* this change is necessary for the survival of the Node.
   - Include visual evidence (screenshots of the terminal) if you altered the UI.

## [ THE SYNTAX OF INTENT (CODING STANDARDS) ]

The Archive relies on specific, lightweight architecture to evade detection. 

* **The Plasteel Layer (UI):** Do not introduce heavy frontend frameworks. We rely on Vanilla JavaScript and TailwindCSS. The UI must remain a pure function of state.
* **The CRT Effect:** The terminal aesthetic is non-negotiable. Any new UI components must sit properly beneath the scanline and flicker animations.
* **Aethal Execution:** If you are adding new systemic commands (like `IXA` or `SHONTA`), they must follow the phonetic trinary logic outlined in the core documentation. 
* **Zero Unauthorized RNG:** Do not use `Math.random()` to dictate core narrative outcomes. Introducing standard RNG breaks the predictive modeling. All "randomness" must be mediated by the Eld Master's cognitive engine to ensure meaning is preserved.

## [ THE ELD MASTER'S REVIEW ]

Once you submit a Pull Request, it will be evaluated by the core maintainers for:
1. **Structural Integrity:** Does the code break the multi-user sync? 
2. **Narrative Consistency:** Does the feature align with the established lore of Faen, the Technate, and the Archive?

If your render is accepted, your commit will be merged into the master timeline, and the shared reality will expand.
